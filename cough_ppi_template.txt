Once daily proton pump inhibitors are inadequate to suppress acid over the full 24 hours such as is required in reflux cough. We therefore use Lansoprazole 30mg bd with meals and Ranitidine 300mg at night. We should try this regime for two months and if this is unsuccessful we will move onto drugs which enhance the motility of the gullet. Metoclopramide 10mg tds for 1 month should be tried followed by Domperidone 10mg tds for one month. If both strategies fail we should try Baclofen. This GABA agonist enhances the tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter and it should be started at the dose of 5mg tds, gradually increasing depending upon the effect/side-effect. I would recommend that an ECG is performed to check the QTc, before staring treatment with Metoclopramide/Domperidone. 

We have also discussed onwards referral to a specialist cough centre and potential participation in trials and that studies have some some benefit of a trial medication gefapixant or more selective P2X3 but has had disturbances in taste are a common side effect.
