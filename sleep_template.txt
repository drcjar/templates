I have explained to Mr/Mrs xx that we will arrange a sleep study to investigate for obstructive sleep apnoea. If this results in mild obstructive sleep apnoea, we will consider a referral for a mandibular advancement device, if it results in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea, we will offer a trial of CPAP. More information is available on the Sleep Apnoea Trust Website.  
 
I have given lifestyle advice with regards to smoking cessation, reducing alcohol intake and weight loss.  xx may also find sleeping apps based cognitive behavioural therapy such as 'Sleepio' or 'Sleepstation' which may be available from the GP helpful. 
 
We will write to him/her with the results of the sleep study.  
 
Kind regards,
