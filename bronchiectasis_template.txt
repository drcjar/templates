 I have explained that the mainstay of treatment in bronchiectasis is keeping healthy, active and preventing further damage and infections. We discussed the importance of annual vaccinations, airway clearance techniques and treatment of chest infections with a 2 week course of antibiotics. It is also important to control undelying diseases.

 Plan:



 I would be grateful if you would provide with a flu vaccination, if this has not already been offered this year. They would also benefit from a Pneumovax vaccination and needs to ensure that she is up-to-date with all her COVID vaccinations.

 If pneumococcal antibodies are low, immunise with 23 valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, followed by measurement of specific antibody levels 4â€“8 weeks later.
 Test for cystic fibrosis in patients with supporting clinical features, for example, early onset, male infertility, malabsorption, pancreatitis. 
 Test for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) (accordingto ERS Guidelines for PCD Diagnosis) in patients with supporting clinical features, including a history of  neonatal distress, symptoms from childhood, recurrent otitis media, rhinosinusitis, or infertility.
